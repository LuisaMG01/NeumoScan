The notebooks folder within the NEUMOSCANER project is designed to host interactive notebooks that facilitate exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and incremental model development. 
Its use is key for prototyping tasks and documenting scientific processes within the projectâ€™s workflow.

This folder centralizes the Jupyter Notebooks associated with the project. The notebooks allow for:
- Developing and testing code interactively.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Documenting findings and step-by-step procedures.
- Facilitating reproducibility and helping other team members understand the workflow.
