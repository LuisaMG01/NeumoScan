# NeumoScan

> An artificial intelligence system to predict and classify pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images.

##  Project Description

NeumoScan is a deep learning-based tool designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Beyond determining the presence of pneumonia, it can classify it as **bacterial** or **viral**. The main goal is to support healthcare professionals in making fast and accurate diagnoses using artificial intelligence.
